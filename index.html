Biodiversity, or biological diversity, is a term that refers to the number of genes, species, individual organisms within a given species, and biological communities within a defined geographic area, ranging from the smallest ecosystem to the global biosphere. (A biological community is an interacting group of various species in a common location.) Likewise, biodiversity loss describes the decline in the number, genetic variability, and variety of species, and the biological communities in a given area. This loss in the variety of life can lead to a breakdown in the functioning of the ecosystem where decline has happened.</div>

                <h4 class="effect_para">Food wastage impacts on biodiversity loss at a global level. In order to
                    maximize agricultural
                    yields, farmers have increasingly invaded wild areas in search of more fertile lands which has led
                    to the loss of biodiversity. The reason for this is that practices such as slash and burn,
                    deforestation, and conversion of wild areas into farmlands have destroyed the natural habitats for
                    birds, fish, mammals, and amphibians.
                    Agricultural practices such as mono-cropping have also compounded biodiversity loss. The mass
                    rearing of livestock for consumption and the use of pesticides in crop production has also
                    significantly contributed to nitrogen, phosphorous, and chemical pollution in streams, rivers, and
                    coastal waters thus affecting marine life.</h4>

                    service providers and consumers. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported that
                    approximately one-third of all produced foods globally (1.3 billion tons of edible food) for human
                    consumption is lost and wasted every year across the supply chain.

                <h4 class="effect_para1">The volume of water used in agricultural food production is immense. Therefore,
                    if 30 percent of all the food produced goes to waste, then it means that more than 30 percent of
                    freshwater used in the production and processing of food also goes to waste. This contributes to
                    blue water footprint which refers to the amount of consumed surface and groundwater resources that
                    goes to waste.
                    Precise estimations indicate that food wastage is responsible for the wastage of nearly 250 cubic
                    kilometers (km3) of water. This wastage is equivalent to thrice the volume of Lake Geneva. It is
                    also affirmed that throwing out a kilogram of beef amounts to a waste of 50,000 liters of water used
                    in the meat production process. Similarly, 1000 liters of water is wasted if one glass of milk is

        <h2 class="para5">***How to reduce food waste***</h2>
        <div>
            <h3 class="para2">While the average consumer is not a large environmental polluter compared to large
                corporations, finding
                ways to reduce food waste throughout the day can help a person avoid contributing to the problem. In
                this article, learn about how to reduce food waste in the home, at school, and on the go.</h3>
            <ul class="listofcontrol">
                <li class="points_5"> 1) One of the simplest ways to avoid food waste as a consumer is to buy less. A
                    packed fridge may look appealing, but it may lead to food waste if the household cannot eat all of
                    the food.</li>
                <li class="points_5"> 2) While mold is a definite sign that something belongs in the garbage, it is not
                    necessary to throw out foods that are slightly past their prime.
                    For instance, many greens and vegetables may slightly soften or wilt when they are just past ripe.
                    They still may make excellent additions to soups, smoothies, or baked dishes</li>
                <li class="points_5"> 3) Buying foods that are already in the home can ultimately become another source
                    of waste. Taking an inventory of the food in the house and making a grocery list before going to the
                    store
                    might help people avoid purchasing unnecessary foods and cut back on potential waste.

                </li>
                <li class="points_5"> 4) Organizing the fridge and pantry can help people keep track of what they have
                    at
                    home and help them to identify foods that are ready to eat.
                    “FIFO” stands for “first in, first out” and is a useful way to organize food at home. Many
                    restaurants and grocery stores use this system to reduce waste, too.</li>
                <li class="points_5"> 5) Perishable items, such as fruits and vegetables, each have their best way to
                    store
                    to avoid spoilage.
                    Some tips include:
                    keeping the refrigerator below 5°C (41°F),
                    storing cooked foods on shelves above raw foods,
                    storing food in sealed containers</li>
                <li class="points_5"> 6) Making a meal menu for the week may help some people organize their food usage
                    and
                    cut back on waste.
                    Using online tools or cookbooks to help plan out meals for the week can a person to compile an
                    accurate shopping list.
                    It may take a few weeks for each household to get the menu right, but having a set weekly menu might
                    help some people reduce the guesswork around meals and avoid wasting food.</li>
                <li class="points_5"> 7) When eating out, a person can avoid food waste by asking for a meal that does
                    not
                    contain ingredients they do not enjoy.
                    For instance, if brunch at a restaurant comes with a side of toast that a person would not usually
                    eat, merely asking them to leave off the toast can help prevent waste.
                    In addition to reducing waste, smaller portions can also help prevent a person from overeating.</li>
                <li class="points_5"> 8) When eating in a dining hall or other establishment that uses food trays,
                    opting to
                    avoid the food tray may help prevent waste.
                    A 2012 study found that not using a food tray reduced food waste by 32% in a university dining hall.
